title: 'Artifacts retention policy update'
---

To reduce AppVeyor hosting costs and eliminate any unnecessary waste of cloud resources back in 2018 we introduced artifacts retention policy.

The original policy was keeping paid account artifacts for 6 months and free account artifacts for 3 months. NuGet packages are kept intact.

Based on the feedback from our community we are changing artifacts retention period for paid accounts to 3 months and free accounts to 1 month. NuGet packages are kept intact.

This policy will take effect on April 5, 2021.

If you have custom requirements please let us know and we'll discuss your needs.

Best regards,<br>
AppVeyor team
