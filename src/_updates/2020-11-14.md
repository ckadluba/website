## .NET 5 impact

.NET 5 is now part of Visual Studio 2019 16.8.x installation and thus default .NET Core when building your projects.

This can break some projects without .NET Core version pinning.

To build your projects with the latest .NET Core 3.1 add `global.json` to the root of project repository (or working folder from which `dotnet` or `msbuild` commands are run) with the following contents:

```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "3.1.102",
    "rollForward": "latestFeature"
  }
}
```

## Previous worker image

There is a build worker image available from previous deployment. You can use it in case of any issues with the current image:

`Previous Visual Studio 2019`

You can select build worker image in "Build worker image" dropdown on Environment tab of project settings or if you use `appveyor.yml`:

```yaml
image: Previous Visual Studio 2019
```
